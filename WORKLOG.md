# Work Log

## GROUP MEMBER 1 Manoel Jeremias-Neto

### date 5/22/24

started work on Monkey / Dart classes

### date 5/23/24

added the ability to place DartMonkeys, and the dartMonkeys now shoot at the first bloon in the Bloons arraylist that is in range. next i will work on a upgrade menu to allow for monkey upgrades and deletion (eventually, target priority as well)

### date 5/24/24

monkeys no longer able to be placed on other monkeys or the track. the spacing is kinda scuffed due to how i did it but thats probably fine for demo / MVP. next (tommorow) i will work on the sidebar funtionality (buying dartmonkeys or upgrading existing dartmonkeys) as well as adding dartmonkey upgrades.

## GROUP MEMBER 2 Renxuan Pang

### date 5/22/24

finished basic map drawing draw loop, made the map randomizer based off of maze solver, tomorrow will start working on guider class and on balloon basic movement functions.

### date 5/23/24

finished bloon pathing, got them to move. I wrote a new recursive function to place in guiders in the right order, this was not on the class diagram. I did this because I realized the previous wasn't working. Tomorrow I will not be in class due to choir, but I will update on the homework. I will change the graphics, and look into implementing life system.

### date 5/24/24

updated the graphics a bit, made a somewhat functional side bar, tried making the pictures rotate but it turned out to be a lot more broken than I thought, so might give up that idea. Will work on more things tomorrow.
