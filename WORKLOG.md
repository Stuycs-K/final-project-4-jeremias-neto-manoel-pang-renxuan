### date 5/22/24

finished basic map drawing draw loop, made the map randomizer based off of maze solver, tomorrow will start working on guider class and on balloon basic movement functions.

### date 5/23/24

finished bloon pathing, got them to move. I wrote a new recursive function to place in guiders in the right order, this was not on the class diagram. I did this because I realized the previous wasn't working. Tomorrow I will not be in class due to choir, but I will update on the homework. I will change the graphics, and look into implementing life system.

### date 5/24/24

updated the graphics a bit, made a somewhat functional side bar, tried making the pictures rotate but it turned out to be a lot more broken than I thought, so might give up that idea. Will work on more things tomorrow. 

### date 5/25/24

added a start button to the game, giving time to place towers. Also did bloon spawn logic (subject to change) so they keep spawning, and also added life losing logic. Bloons can now be popped. Need work on the piercing mechanic for darts. 

### date 5/26/24

added correct life system based on bloon hierachy, added a money system, added bloon types up to pinks, tuned speed of bloons so when they pop from pink to yellow or yellow to green they slow down, added a basic round system, might improve upon it later. Mostly spent time adding all the different bloons. Soon will add sfx to popping

### date 5/28/24

added graphical updates to the side bar, added in the sidebar sprites, added graphical updates to start button, added sfx when bloons pop, most importantly added a BGM and pop sound :)

### date 5/29/24

added a page flip system for sidebar, added a few more rows to the sidebar, fixed bug with bloon spawning, tmrw will likely work on round mechanics.

### date 5/30/24

added rounds up to round 10, got zebra bloons working, got a model for adding bloons of higher hierachy. Tomorrow likely will add up to round 20-ish

### date 5/31/24

added money interactions for the placable monkeys in the side bar, added a round counter, added a grayscale system for when a monkey is unpurchaseable. will work on future rounds over weekend likely. 

### date 6/1/24

graphics update for road and hearts, added rounds up to round 20 and playtested, need fixes on dart lifetime for dart monkey, and need to fix a few things with upgrading correctly.
