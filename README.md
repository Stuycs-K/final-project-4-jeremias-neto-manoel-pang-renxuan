## Overview
This is a recreation of the hit popping tower defense game Bloons td 5, but also incorporating some BTD 6 elements (btd 5.5?). In this project, you will be challenged with the rounds from 1-40, and it will be your job to place down monkeys and towers to defend against bloons from red to the almighty MOAB (mother of all bloons). With every pop, you will gain some amount of money (you also gain money from finishing a round), which you could use to purchase towers; purchasable towers are lit up, while unpurchasable ones are grayed out. You can also use this money to upgrade your pre-existing towers to get even more firepower against those snarky bloons. Make decisions about placing towers wisely and defend your hometown!
## Instructions
Use left click to select towers from the sidebar when available, left click again on anywhere thats NOT the track and NOT too close to other towers to place towers. The towers will automatically pop up a upgrade bar on the right when placed, click on anywhere not on the track or other monkeys to close that bar. Click on the monkey you would like to upgrade to see that menu again and upgrade them. Click the green button on the bottom right to start a round. The green button appears after the end of every round. 
## Major bugs
Currently, the known bug is that the music files sometimes bugs out and become all static, likely due to a memory issue and occurence seems to be random- We couldn't figure out a clear pattern to the bug happening.
